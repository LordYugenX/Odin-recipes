# Odin-recipes
 this webpage was done for the recipes project on The Odin Project
 I was flexing my creative muscles on the Lasagna.html page so dont mind that one lol
 maybe i will do that more often in future challanges no way to tell for sure 
 this was a **fun project** for sure I encourage everyone to at least try it
 if they are remotely interested in web development
